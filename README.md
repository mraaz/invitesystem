# invitesystem
I was looking at a way to automate my invitations for my regualr poker games.
It was taking up to 3-4 hours for each event and we have an event every three weeks for the past 11 years. The admin time quickly adds up.
The other criteria was that, it needed to be completetly free. We couldn't afford to pay any ongoing fee's

Tasks that the invitation needs to do:

1. Send out an initial email inviting everyone in the mailing list to the event every three weeks at a certain time and day of the week.
First ten users to reply back will be added to the game, everyone else will be added to the reserve list.

Throughout the week if the invited players decided they cannot attend anymore, they can decline their invite and the next person in the reserve list will get the invite.

2. Players want to see who is currently coming to the poker event
3. Players want to see the dates for the upcoming games
4. Players want to get the details of the event, ie address, cost, rules...etc
5. I wanted to use Google api and Python as this is something I've never used before

The goal is to have Zero admin time devoted to this, aswell as zero system admin time maintaining the app.
